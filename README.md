# Fullstack Authentication System (MERN Stack)

A complete Fullstack Authentication System built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. This project provides a robust and secure foundation for user authentication in web applications.

## Installation

This section provides detailed instructions on how to set up and run the Fullstack Authentication System locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

-   **Node.js:**  Version 16 or higher is recommended. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
-   **npm:**  Node Package Manager (usually installed with Node.js). Verify installation by running `npm -v` in your terminal.
-   **MongoDB:**  Install MongoDB Community Edition. Follow the instructions on the official MongoDB website: [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/). Make sure MongoDB is running.
-   **Git:**  Required for cloning the repository. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, clone the repository using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/fullstack-authentication-system.git
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd fullstack-authentication-system
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    This project consists of a server and a client application. Install the dependencies for both.

    **Server-side (Backend):**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

    **Client-side (Frontend):**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.  Add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/auth_db
    JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY
    ```

    *   `PORT`:  The port the server will run on.  Defaults to 5000.
    *   `MONGODB_URI`:  The connection string for your MongoDB database.  Adjust if your MongoDB server is running on a different host or port.
    *   `JWT_SECRET`:  A secret key used for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).  This should be a strong, randomly generated string for security.

    **Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to a public repository. Add it to your `.gitignore` file.

## Usage

This section describes how to run the application and provides examples of API endpoints.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run dev
    cd ..
    ```

    This will start the backend server using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server when changes are detected. If you don't want auto restart use `npm start`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Application:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    cd ..
    ```

    This will start the React development server, typically running on `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Access the Application:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

### API Endpoints

The following are the main API endpoints provided by the backend server:

*   `POST /api/register`:  Registers a new user.  Expects `username`, `email`, and `password` in the request body.
*   `POST /api/login`:  Logs in an existing user.  Expects `email` and `password` in the request body.
*   `GET /api/user`: Retrieves user data if the token is valid. Requires authentication via JWT token in the `Authorization` header. (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

**Note:**  These are example endpoints.  Refer to the server-side code (specifically the `routes` directory) for a complete list of available endpoints and their expected parameters.

## Features

*   **User Registration:**  Allows new users to create accounts.
*   **User Login:**  Enables registered users to log in to the application.
*   **Authentication using JWT:** Uses JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
*   **Password Hashing:**  Stores passwords securely using bcrypt.
*   **Role-Based Authorization (Planned):**  Future implementation to support different user roles and permissions.
*   **Protected Routes:**  Secures specific routes that require authentication.
*   **Modern MERN Stack:** Leverages the power and flexibility of the MERN stack.
*   **Responsive UI:** React-based client provides a responsive user interface.
